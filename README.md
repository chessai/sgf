# SGF

This is a parser for the go/igo/weiqi/baduk fragment of the SGF format.
Encodings latin-1, utf-8, and ascii are supported, and the parser strives
to be robust to minor errors, especially those made by the most common SGF
editors.  There are plans to support other games and pretty-printing in
future releases.
